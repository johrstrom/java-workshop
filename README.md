# WorkShop

This repo is meant to be a tutorial for a few people I work with. The idea is we learn java and computer science and this repo can be the so called cheat sheet at the back of the book. This repo and the source within is not meant to be __the__ answer, only __a__ __possible__ answer. 

Each Tag is a completed assgiment, so if you pull this repo check out the tags for a given assignment. That is, tag v1 is the first assigment v2 the second and so on. 

Each assignment is documented on the wiki of this repo and there should be links here on this README.
